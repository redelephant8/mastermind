This is a mastermind game where you can either be the code creator or the code solver. When you are the code creator, you enter a 4 digit code, and the computer attempts to figure out the code within 12 rounds.
When you are the code solver, the computer makes a code and you have to try to solve the code within 12 rounds.
Each round you are given hints that tell you whether the pegs are the right color and in the right space or if they are the right color but the wrong space.
